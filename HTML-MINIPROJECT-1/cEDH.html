    <div class=content>
        <p>
          cEDH is a very different format compared to the other two, as it is one, an 
          unsanctioned format, and two, a daughter format of Commander, a casual format. The rules and 
          banlist of cEDH is regulated by a body outside of MTG. This comes with some disadvantages. 
          <ol>
              <li>There is little tournament data to figure out what cards and decks are "meta" or a problem in matchups (although this is changing as COVID-19 dies down and the format grows</li>
              <li>While the commander format is extremely popular, cEDH as a daughter format can be less accounted for inn accordance to rule changes and bans</li>
          </ol>
          <p>
              Now, this dosent mean it is all bad, infact, cEDH is more popular than ever as a format with the resurgence of in-person play and online play resources developed because of COVID-19. And the lack of tournament data does not mean there are no tounaments, it just means they are held by other entities that offer similar cash prizes, and one even offered the rarest card in Magic: the Gathering, a Black Lotus, as prizing for the person who took 1st place at that tournament.
          </p>
        </p>
        <p>
            cEDH has a few more unique rules, so I will explain some of them below.
            <ol>
                <li>You choose a legendary creature to be your Commander, and you may cast them as if it was in your hand</li>
                <li>You must include 99 cards other than the Commander, no more, no less</li>
                <li>You can include any card printed in the history of MTG (other than banned cards)</li>
                <li>You cannot not include any banned cards in a deck</li>

            </ol>
        </p>
        <p>
            cEDH is an outlier format in regards to the other two formats discussed here, but I decided to include it because it displays the immense diversity of playstyles and deckbuilding options that MTG offers its players. No matter what type of player you are, you can always find a format for you, and that's what unsancioned formats do in comparison to sancioned formats, it creates a diverse set of playstyles that you can use to enjoy the game outside of MTG-endorsed formats.
