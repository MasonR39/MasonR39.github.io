    <div class=title>Modern</div>

        <p>
         Modern is considered one of the quintessential formats to pick up and play because of the shear amount of 
         diversity between playstyles and deck types that you can experience youself, or from playing against an opponent. 
        </p>
        <p>
         The Modern format was introduced to the MTG playerbase as a 2-player format on May 19th, 2011 on Magic's website: MTG Online as a "Non-Sanctioned" format 
         (meaning that it could not be played in tournaments endosed by MTG), but immediately gained mass 
         popularity on the site, leading to its official codification into Magic's list of formats on August 12th of the same year. 
         Since then, the format has grown massively and has held many in-person tournaments, inviting people from across the world to play for cash prizes.
        </p>
        <p>
            The (basic) rules of Modern are as follows: 
         <ul>
                <li>You must have a minimum of 60 cards in a deck</li>
                <li>You cannot have more than 4 copies of the same card (excluding lands)</li>
                <li>You must construct decks with cards released from Eighth Edition (July 2003) - Present Day</li>
                <li>You are prohibited from including any banned cards in your decks (see banlist for all sanctioned formats <a href=https://magic.wizards.com/en/banned-restricted-list>here</a>)</li>
         </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            Because it was released in 2011, the amount of change the format has went through is massive, but still keeps a mostly consistent playerbase over time. Modern is very deiverse in how you can play, with a large amount of decks that comprise the competetive meta of Modern. Although, to play competitively, the price of a deck that can do so often costs $100s dollars.
        </p>
        <p>
            Because of the impact COVID-19 has on MTG as a whole, the overall playerbase of the Modern format had faltered over that time, but has been recovering as COVID-19 restirictions are lifted across the world and organized play begins to pick up again.
