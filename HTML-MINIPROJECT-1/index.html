    <div class="title">Formats of Magic: The Gathering</div><br>
   <div class=content>Magic the Gathering (MTG) is a tabletop card game (TCG), in where you construct
    a deck with the intent to defeat your opponent. MTG can be played in many different mediums with 
    hundreds of varying ways to play. Outside of the rules of the game, there are many interesting mechanics that keep the game fresh and 
    intersting, one of those being the topic of this article: Formats. Here, I will outline some light 
    history and a description of the chosen formats, including the rules. 
    There are 3 formats that will be explored here, 
    but a larger amount of MTG formats exist within the game. 
    The 3 that have been chosen are: Modern, Pioneer, and Competitive Commander 
    (cEDH) and will be explained on the following pages<br>
</p>

If you are unfamiliar with the rules of Magic: the Gathering, you can inform yourself <a class="NONCL"href=https://magic.wizards.com/en/rules>here.</a> (this is not required to understand the following pages)<br>
<div class=headers><h1>Overview</h1></div><br>
   
    In MTG, a format is a set of restrictions within the normal game rules that limit 4 major things (smaller limitations also exist but aren't as important):
   <ol><li>The minimum (and/or maximum) amount of cards you may have in your deck</li>
    <li>The card pool you are allowed to use to build a deck</li>
    <li>The amount of the same card you may have in a deck (excluding land cards, they have no cap on the amount you can include)</li>
    <li>Banned and resticted cards</li>
</ol>
  <p>Some formats only tell you the minimum amount of cards you need to have a legal deck, but others, like cEDH, have a cap on the amount of cards you can include. 
   Your card pool is a group or list of sets (a set is a pool of ~250 cards released together, with a theme connecting each card in that set) that you can use cards from to build a deck. Formats like cEDH have a limit of 1 of the same cards you can use in a deck, while Modern and Pioneer have a maximium of 4 of the same card you can use in the deck.
   And the banned and restricted cards are ones considered "too powerful" by those in charge of the format(s). You nay not include a banned card in your deck, but you can include only one card that is restricted.
   When a deck dominates a format, and makes people either play the deck themselves, or run a deck that counters it, it is considered too powerful and will often have a key card banned to keep the format healthy.
</p>
   <p>
       Each format attempts to make it so there is a large diversity in the decks that can be played competitively, hence the inclusion of the "Banned and Restricted" list.
    </p>
