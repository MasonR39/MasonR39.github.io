        <p>
            Pioneer is similar to the early modern format, a smaller card pool, and sets do not rotate out of the format. 
            Although, the exclusion of a larger amount of sets creates a tighter meta, and results in certain decks dominating, but arent powerful enough to recieve a ban. Although, the format is still diverse in deck types and playstyles.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Pioneer format was introduced to the playerbase on October 21st 2019 after much anticipation, and officially codified on January 30th, 2020, and immediately included in tourmament play. since then, it has seen sustained popularity and increased tournament play into this decade  
        </p>
        The (basic) rules of Pioneer are as follows:
        <ul>
            <li>You must have a minimum of 60 cards in a deck</li>
            <li>You cannot have more than 4 copies of the same card in a deck (excluding lands)</li>
            <li>You must construct decks with cards released form Return to Ravnica (October 2012) - Present Day</li>
            <li>You are prohibited from including any banned cards in your decks</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Pioneer has very similar rules compared to modern, but the exclusion of cards earlier than October 2012 creates a mass difference in the types of decks that people play and the playstyles that you can use.
